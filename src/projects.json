By leveraging the current network to upgrade the infrastructure, the vRDC aims to increase the capacity of the RDC network to handle the advanced statistical analysis of large data files, facilitating more research activity and increasing productivity for all researchers.&#x000A;The vRDC will centralize computing resources, improve performance and disaster recovery, and support remote access for accredited RDC researchers across Canada. The infrastructure consists of two central servers located at the University of Waterloo (UW) and Simon Fraser University (SFU), as well as more than three hundred thin clients that will replace the local servers and workstations in the RDCs. The storage of StatCan's microdata files will be centralized at the UW and SFU servers, and all connections to the central servers will be protected via an encrypted Virtual Private Network (VPN).</p>",
